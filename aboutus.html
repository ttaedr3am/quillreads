        <h1>About Us</h1>
    
    <h3>Who We Are:</h3>

       <p>A team of three passionate book lovers who believe stories are meant to be shared, not shelved.
        
        Readers first, founders second — united by our mission to make reading affordable and accessible for everyone.</p>
        
       <h3> What We Do:</h3>
        
        <p>Provide an online platform where users can rent and exchange books with fellow readers across the country.
        
        Encourage a community-driven model that promotes sharing over buying, making reading more sustainable.</p>
        
       <h3> Our Goals:</h3>
        
        <p>Make reading an economically sustainable hobby for students, casual readers, and bibliophiles alike.
        
        Build a thriving community of readers who support one another through book sharing.
        
        Reduce the environmental impact of publishing by extending the life of each book through reuse.</p>       
        <h3>Why We Started This:</h3>
        
        <p>We saw how expensive reading could get and wanted to create a budget-friendly alternative.
        
        We believe that stories are meant to travel, not gather dust on shelves.
        
        We wanted to bring people together over their shared love for books — creating a space where reading meets connection.</p>
        
       <h3> What Makes Us Different:</h3>
        
        <p>A peer-to-peer model that lets you rent or exchange directly with others.
        
        Curated for book lovers, by book lovers — with a focus on trust, transparency, and community.
        
        A platform where every book finds a new reader, and every reader finds a new world.</p>
